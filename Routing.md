Routing conventions
1. All routes must live inside the app folder
2. Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path

When these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as
a route.
## Folder Structure Example

app/
 ├── blog/
 │    └── page.js
 ├── layout.js
 └── page.js
